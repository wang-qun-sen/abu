# LDMNet: Low Dimensional Manifold Regularized Neural Networks

Implementation of the article
'''
    LDMNet: Low Dimensional Manifold Regularized Neural Networks 
'''

This project contains the python source and matlab source code for LDMNet.

The python source include mnist_1.py and mnist_2.py, mnist_1.py contains the identity-layer.
And mnist_2.py contains the multi-task loss.

The matlab source use the MatConvNet toolbox, look the README.md in matlab fold for detail.
